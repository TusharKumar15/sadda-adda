## How to view on local server
since I could not commit the files on github properly, we have to view the website properly through local server. To perform this, we need to:
1. create react app - Run: npx create-react-app appname
2. replace the public and src folder with those in my code
3. install react router dom - Run: npm install react-router-dom
4. Run: npm start
Extremely sorry for this inconvinience
