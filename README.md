# sadda-adda
Sadda adda is a website where we can share, like, dislike, edit or delete our posts. Note: the assgn_3 folder has no importance.
## since I could not commit the files on github properly, we have to view the website properly through local server. For this create a react-app, then replace public and src with the one in this code. then install react router dom.
